submission to the shell shader thing

## camera

I used [this](https://gist.github.com/FreyaHolmer/650ecd551562352120445513efa1d952) for the camera.
WASD, space, ctrl, shift. E to move faster, Q to move slower.

## the build

The build is for windows 64 bit. it is only for the Cone scene, use the editor to see the others.
